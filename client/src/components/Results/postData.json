  "body" : "This is a long one but I feel it’s important to give as much information as I can. I really hope someone will read and maybe respond with their thoughts on this. I’m not sure what I’m looking for, even if it helps someone in a similar situation feel a little less alone then that’s something. Nearly 6 months ago the love of my life ended our relationship. I feel like it's slowly killing me and as time goes on I am getting more and more depressed. I have experienced a lot of trauma over the years, but this has got to be the most tragic and heartbreaking thing I've gone through, and that's really saying something. I (35F) met my now ex (32M) just over 2 years ago, organically, and on a random night out. We hit it off right away and had incredible chemistry. As time went on it appeared we were also compatible and had similar values and goals, we were very alike in some ways. We fell deeply in love, it was as though we'd known each other in another life, we just got one another. He was going through a divorce but it wasn't an issue to me. He was always so open, he'd tell me that he always struggled with feeling misunderstood but he felt that I had so much understanding and patience for him. What he loved about me was how loved he felt and my ability to accept all of him and give him so much warmth. He told me he'd never had this much of a connection with anyone, he'd never had such a loving and intimate relationship. And despite my history of toxic relationships with emotionally unavailable or abusive men, I felt so incredibly lucky to have found him, I felt so loved, seen, and secure for the first time in a relationship. He used to tell me that when he was with me he felt recharged. In this time we'd already spoken about our future together and how having children and our own home was something we both wanted, and for the first time in my life I was able to really envision that happening with him.",
